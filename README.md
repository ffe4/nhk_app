This is a simple web app to search the NHK Pitch Accent Dictionary.
It depends on data extracted from the discontinued android app [NHK日本語発音アクセント辞典 新版](https://web.archive.org/web/20170702031749/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.est.android.DejizoDic.Accent), which is not included in the repository due to copyright. **The app will not run without!**

If you happen to have the app installed on a rooted device, you can put the `Accend-snd.db` and extracted `Accent.exi` into a folder named `data` to run the app. If you need help extracting the `Accent.exi` file contact me.
